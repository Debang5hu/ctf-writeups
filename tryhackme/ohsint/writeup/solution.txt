what i did for the last one is,I used gobuster to scan the hidden directory and got an interesting dir "/atom" i just opened it and got a file to download,after downloading I found a weird string and that came to be the password!
Another way! In the wordpress site you can use 'ctrl+a' to highlight every text and you will find the password too (cause its been written in white color so it was not visible before highlighting).
