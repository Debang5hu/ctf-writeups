First of all connect to tryhackme vpn and spawn the machine :)

then do a network scan on the target and list the open ports,we will find that http is opened,so we will open the webpage "<targetip>:80"

1.Introduction:
-----------------

[*] no answer is needed for the first question 

[*] refer to the "nmap scan"/"rustscan",for the second answer
 
[*] read the paragraph to get the third answer


then click the embedded link of the webpage to go another page,you wont find anything interest in the webpage,but don't to view the page source! 
after getting something useful in the page source,open the link "targetip/useful_directory"

========================================================================================================================================================

2. The Mansion:
----------------

[*] just dare to take the emblem to get something interesting,then do accordingly,sure you gonna fall into the rabbit hole!

check the page source,you will get a cipher,use "cyberchef" to decode that you will get a hint to get into another directory "<targetip>/new_directory"

[*] click the embedded link to get the next flag!

also don't forget to read the para to get the next hint of the challenge
check the embedded link 
explore other rooms
enter the lockpick to get into the room,then click on READ to get the note

[*] use cyberchef to decode the music note and get the next flag

then submit you new flag under "play the piano" to get into another room

[*] take the gold emblem to get the gold emblem flag


[*] go to "<targetip>/diningRoom/" put the gold emblem flag and you will get a viginere cipher and the key is the name we got from secret bar room  
"klfvg ks r wimgnd biz mpuiui ulg fiemok tqod. Xii jvmc tbkg ks tempgf tyi_hvgct_jljinf_kvc"(vigenere cipher) after decoding it visit the page ["<targetip>/diningRoom/got_after_decryption.html"] to get the flag


then for the blue gem flag go to the next directory i.e, "/diningRoom2F"

read the page source and get a long cipher,you can use "dcode.fr/cipher-identifier" to identify the cipher and then decode it to get it in plain text

[*] do accordingly and to the said directory to get the blue gem flag (the said directoy <targetip>/diningRoom/file_got_after_decoding) 

then get to the next directory "tigerStatusRoom" and enter the blue gen flag to get information about crest1
then go the next directory "galleryRoom" and examine to get the info regarding crest2 
similarly visit "/armorRoom" and enter the shield flag to get crest3 and visit "/attic" and enter the shield key to get the crest4 
then add them and get the cipher text again decode it to get the ftp credentials.

[*] we just got the ftp username
[*] we just got the ftp password

=============================================================================================================================================
3. The guard house:
--------------------
It's  a Forensics Challenge!
Now log into the FTP server:
and get all the files into your device by typing "mget *"

to decrypt the "gpg" file you need a password and that can be found from the images

key1=use steghide to extract a text file from the 001-key.jpg [steghide --extract -sf 001-key.jpg (the password is '' )]
key2=use exiftool to get the string from the 002-key.jpg [exiftool 002-key.jpg (we will get the string from the comment field)]
key3=for the 003-key.jpg use foremost to extract the third key [foremost -i 003-key.jpg (unzip the zip file to get the third key)] 

now: key=key1+key2+key3

decrypt the key(which is base64 encoded) to get the pass and open the "gpg" file [gpg -d helmet_key.txt.gpg]
and we get the helmet key

[*] read the important.txt to get the answer
[*] we used it for opening the "gpg" file
[*] we just got it from the "gpg" file

=================================================================================================================================================

4.The Revisit
--------------

now open thoes doors which required the helmet flag (studyRoom and hiddenCloset)

from study room we will get a file to download,download and extract the file to get the ssh username

[*] ssh_username we just got
[*] examine the wolf medal to get the ssh_password
[*] read the paragraph of the closet room to get the answer

read the MO disk 1 of the closet room  to get a cipher (use "dcode.fr/cipher-identifier" and decrypt it)

========================================================================================================================================================

5. Underground laboratory:
---------------------------

time to use the reverse shell <3

"ssh ssh_username@<targetip>" and we already have the password

do "ls -la"
to see all the files including the hidden ones

 ["find . -name chris.* 2>/dev/null" (you can use this command to find chris and get the answer)]

[*] use can use the previous command or else you can get into every dir and find for chris
[*] just follow the chris.txt
[*] decode the cipher which we got from closet room using the key "albert" (we did it previously though)
[*] just get into  home/weasker/ and read the "weasker_note.txt" for the answer

now time to get root priviledges

we dont find anything interesting in here,but we can get into weasker user since we have his username and password,just create a new ssh session login with the credentials 

just do "sudo su" and enter the same password of weasker which we got before,he re-used the password and boom we are root

[*] now just read the root.txt ("cat /root/root.txt")
